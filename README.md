📘 Data Science Practice📘

 Overview
This repository contains "Jupyter Notebooks" covering Python basics and foundational concepts that are essential for Data Science.  
It is a personal practice space where I explore Python, statistics, and machine learning building blocks.

Topics Covered
- Python Fundamentals  
  - Variables, Strings, Numbers & Boolean values  
  - Operators (Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical)  
  - Iterations & Loops  

- Data Handling Basics  
  - Re-assigning variables  
  - Functions & scope  
  - Working with sequences  

- Introduction to Statistics  
  - Descriptive statistics  
  - Advanced statistical methods  
  - Multiple Linear Regression basics  

 Repository Structure
- `Python_Basics/` → Core Python exercises (variables, strings, operators, loops).  
- `Statistics/` → Notebooks on statistical concepts and regression.  
- `Practice_Exercises/` → Hands-on exercises for reinforcement.  

 Sample Notebooks
- "Arithmetic_operators_in_python.ipynb" – How different operators work.  
- "Copy_of_python_iterations.ipynb" – Loops and iterations in Python.  
- "Advance_statistical_methods(PYTHON).ipynb" – Intro to statistical analysis.  
- "Copy_of_Advanced_Statistical_Methods_Multiple_Linear_Regression.ipynb" – Regression case study.  

 Why This Repo?
- To build a "solid foundation" in Python and Data Science.  
- To maintain a "consistent practice log" while learning.  
- To make learning "transparent & sharable" with recruiters and peers.  

 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- NumPy, Pandas (in some notebooks)
